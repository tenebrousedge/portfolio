##README

This is an untitled portfolio project. There are many others like it, but this one is mine. It's not really all that pretty, although I like the typographic background. I'm not really much of a front-end designer.
I'm sure that I will have more things to list under the projects section when I do more things I am proud of.

###Installation

Clone the repo and double-click on the files until they do something. If they don't do something smash the capitalist system.

###Usage

Take two aspirin and see a doctor if symptoms persist.

###Bugs

Several errors in the mind of the author have been detected and closed #wontfix. 

###Where to Get Help

Being helpless in an uncaring world, the author is unable to assist others. And really, if you need help with this project, you're probably beyond help.

###License

All rights reserved. Just kidding. This is licensed CC0 because copyright doesn't exist on the Internet anyway.

###Contributors

I'd like to thank the Academy, and my parents, but none of them return my phone calls for some reason.
