					<p>One day I decided I wanted to live somewhere warm, so I flew to a foreign country where I didn't speak the language. I really wanted to stay so I talked my way into a programming job with no experience. Since them I've been working freelance, mostly on horrible legacy projects for which every new feature or fixed bug is a Pyrrhic victory that prolongs the life of something that needs to be replaced entirely.</p>

					<h3>What I spent My Morning On</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					<p>So I've been aware of Fabrice Bellard's jslinux project since it was released, and figured that it could be a nice drop-in library that would snazz up a webpage. The general idea was to have a demo of a computer desk where one could turn on the computer and watch in amazement as it actually booted up. This did not work out.</p>
